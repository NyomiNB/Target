This is one of the first projects that I've used the jFrame, jPanel, and paint feature.
 - I used arcs to create the target, and combination of polygons and ovals to give the illusion of an arrow striking a target! 

  - I decided to take some creative liberties regarding the color scheme and am happy with the end product!

  
  Skills used:
  - Importing custom colors
  - Calling fill and set color methods
  - Manipulating the points of shapes for desired affect
